It's like carrying a heavy weight all the time. What you're experiencing is what we call 'psychomotor retardation' - when depression affects your physical energy and motivation. This is a real symptom, not laziness or weakness. Depression affects the brain's chemistry and can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. The fact that you're here, talking about your feelings, shows that you haven't given up - and that's incredibly important. Depression often creates a cycle where low mood leads to reduced activity, which leads to even lower mood. Breaking this cycle is possible, but it often requires professional support. Our therapists can help you develop strategies to gradually increase your activity levels and improve your mood through evidence-based techniques."}

This is completely normal, especially during final year when the stakes feel so high.

This often happens when we push ourselves too hard for too long without adequate rest and self-care. The pressure you're feeling is real, but it's also temporary. Many students go through this phase and come out stronger on the other side. The key is finding balance and remembering that your mental health is just as important as your academic success."}
