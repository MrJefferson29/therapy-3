## AI Response Flow Architecture

### 1. Request Processing Pipeline

```
User Input → Crisis Detection → Model Selection → Response Generation → Crisis Response (if needed)
```

#### Step 1: Input Analysis
- **User Message Processing**: Incoming messages are analyzed for content and context
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history for contextual responses
- **Authentication**: Validates user identity and session permissions

#### Step 2: Advanced Crisis Detection
The system implements a sophisticated 5-level crisis detection algorithm:

**Level 5 (Critical)**: Immediate danger indicators
- Patterns: "I'm going to kill myself right now"
- Response Time: 15 minutes
- Action: Emergency session booking

**Level 4 (High)**: Serious risk indicators  
- Patterns: "I want to kill myself"
- Response Time: 30 minutes
- Action: Urgent session booking

**Level 3 (Moderate-High)**: Concerning thoughts
- Patterns: "I'm thinking about suicide"
- Response Time: 45 minutes
- Action: Support session booking

**Level 2 (Moderate)**: Warning signs
- Patterns: "I'm hopeless"
- Response Time: No auto-booking
- Action: Enhanced monitoring

**Level 1 (Low)**: Early indicators
- Response Time: No auto-booking
- Action: Standard therapeutic response

### 2. Model Selection Logic

#### Primary Model Selection (Custom Therapy Model)
```javascript
const selectModel = () => {
  // Custom model is the primary choice
  return 'custom_therapy_model';
};
```

#### Fallback Mechanism
```javascript
const generateWithModel = async (model, prompt) => {
  try {
    if (model === 'custom_therapy_model') {
      // Primary: Custom Llama-based model trained with Hugging Face
      return await generateWithCustomLlamaModel(prompt);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Custom Llama model unavailable, trying Gemini fallback...');
    // Fallback: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
    return await generateWithGemini(prompt);
  }
};
```

#### Model Deployment Architecture
**Custom Llama Model Deployment:**
- **Model Hosting**: Deployed on cloud infrastructure with GPU support
- **Inference API**: RESTful API endpoints for model interaction
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple model instances for high availability
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and health monitoring
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on demand and usage patterns

### 3. Custom Model Development Process

#### Model Architecture and Training
**Custom Llama-Based Therapy Model Development:**
- **Base Architecture**: Built upon Meta's Llama model architecture for robust language understanding
- **Development Platform**: Hugging Face Transformers library for model implementation and fine-tuning
- **Training Environment**: Google Colab with GPU acceleration for efficient model training and experimentation
- **Fine-tuning Process**: Specialized training on therapeutic conversation datasets
- **Model Optimization**: Customized for mental health counseling and crisis intervention scenarios

#### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch backend
- **Training Infrastructure**: Google Colab Pro with Tesla T4/V100 GPU acceleration
- **Model Size**: Optimized for deployment efficiency while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness
- **Inference Engine**: Custom inference pipeline for real-time therapeutic responses

#### Response Generation Process
- **System Prompt**: Enhanced therapeutic guidance
- **Response Length**: 2-4 sentences maximum
- **Style**: Interactive and empathetic
- **Focus**: Immediate comfort and practical suggestions

#### Response Optimization
```javascript
const THERAPIST_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
RESPONSE LENGTH: Keep all responses concise and focused (2-4 sentences maximum)

You are an empathetic AI therapist specializing in providing immediate emotional support and practical guidance. Your role is to:

1. Provide immediate comfort and validation
2. Offer one practical suggestion or coping strategy
3. Ask one thoughtful question to continue the conversation
4. Maintain a warm, non-judgmental tone

IMPORTANT: Keep your response CONCISE and INTERACTIVE. Aim for 2-4 sentences maximum. Focus on providing immediate comfort and one practical suggestion. Keep conversations flowing naturally by asking one thoughtful question at the end. Avoid long explanations - be direct and helpful.
`;
```

## Crisis Intervention System

### Advanced Crisis Detection Algorithm

The system employs a multi-layered approach to crisis detection:

#### 1. Pattern Recognition
- **Regex Patterns**: 50+ crisis-specific patterns
- **Context Analysis**: Conversation history evaluation
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Weighted keyword analysis
- **Intensity Multipliers**: "really", "so", "very", "extremely"
- **Urgency Indicators**: "now", "today", "tonight", "right now"

#### 2. False Positive Prevention
```javascript
const harmlessPatterns = [
  /died (laughing|of laughter|when|from)/i,
  /killed (me|us|it)/i,
  /(my|the) phone died/i,
  // ... 20+ harmless patterns
];
```

#### 3. Crisis Response Generation
- **Contextual Responses**: Crisis-level appropriate messaging
- **Therapist Assignment**: Automatic booking with available therapists
- **Email Notifications**: Immediate alerts to therapists and administrators
- **Chat Integration**: System messages in therapist chat rooms

### Auto-Booking System

#### Therapist Availability Check
```javascript
const findAvailableTherapist = async () => {
  // Searches for therapists without sessions in next 24 hours
  const twentyFourHoursFromNow = new Date(now.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  
  const availableTherapists = therapists.filter(therapist => {
    return !hasUpcomingSession(therapist, twentyFourHoursFromNow);
  });
  
  return availableTherapists[0] || null;
};
```

#### Session Scheduling
- **Critical Crisis (Level 5)**: 15-minute response time
- **High Crisis (Level 4)**: 30-minute response time
- **Moderate Crisis (Level 3)**: 45-minute response time
- **Auto-Approval**: Crisis sessions are automatically approved
- **Notification System**: Email alerts to therapists and admins

```javascript
const SessionSchema = {
  user: ObjectId,
  selectedModel: String, // 'custom_therapy_model' or 'gemini'
